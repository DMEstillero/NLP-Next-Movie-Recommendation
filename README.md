# NLP Next Movie Recommendation
This project is a program that reads the movie titles and description from the movies.txt file then using spaCY NLP module compares the previously watched movie's description with the other movie descriptions in the file. The program then chooses the movie with the most similar description as the next recommendation for the user.
